# Adapter for connecting Ory Oathkeeper with SpiceDB

It is not possible to directly connect [Ory Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) to [SpiceDB](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb). This adapter allows you to do so.

Oathkeeper [relies](https://www.ory.sh/docs/oathkeeper/pipeline/authz#remote_json) on the http response code from the authorization server (200 OK, 403 Forbidden). The SpiceDB HTTP server does not return the permissions state with the HTTP Response code, but does so in the body of the response.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Binaries

Go to the [release page](https://github.com/EgorHenek/go-oathkeeper-spicedb-adapter/releases) and download the binary for your platform.

For example, on Linux:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/EgorHenek/go-oathkeeper-spicedb-adapter/releases/download/v1.0.1/adapter_1.0.1_linux_amd64 -o go-oathkeeper-spicedb-adapter
chmod +x go-oathkeeper-spicedb-adapter
```

and run:

```bash
./go-oathkeeper-spicedb-adapter
```

#### Docker

docker pull henek/go-oathkeeper-spicedb-adapter:latest
docker run -p 50150:50150 --name osadapter -e SPICE_DB_URL=http://spicedb:50051 -e SPICE_DB_SECRET=topsecret henek/go-oathkeeper-spicedb-adapter
```

**Note:** Don't use the `latest` tag in a production environment.
